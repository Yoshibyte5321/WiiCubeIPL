Planned for user to supply their own GameCube IPL to work, if no IPL is found, will use a barebones menu.
Will probably use some Nintendont Code, could also work with Nintendont
Add a initial setup screen, similar to Nintendo's official IPL settup, but will be expanded upon.
Planned to run off SD card, in a folder called "GC_IPL_MOD"
Planned selectable Boot Menu
