Planned for user to supply their own GameCube IPL to work, if no IPL is found, will use a barebones menu.
Will probably use some Nintendont Code, could also work with Nintendont (See Setup Goals in main)
Add a initial setup screen, similar to Nintendo's official IPL setup, but will be expanded upon.
Planned to run off SD card, in a folder called "GC_IPL_MOD" and can also run off USB Drives and planned to be run off GameCube Memory Cards as Backups of the IPL
Syncing of IPL between SD and Memory Card. When options and config settings are made on SD, automatically start syncing on Memory Card.
Planned selectable Boot Menu. (User can set default)
Target Wii Users, GameCube will likely not be supported, Wii U users will be able to use vWii mode to access WiiCubeIPL from a cafe2wii fowarder (Using this we can get gamepad support)
ONLY COMPATIBLE with Nintendo GameCube Controllers and Wii Classic Controllers, No Wii motes or Nunchucks. (Gamepad support through cafe2wii supported)
Add Languages to "Options" Screen if using IPL that isn't PAL.
Pretty standard memory card save data management screen, allowing for transfer between Memory cards and SD/USB
